***Use of polyester fur for soft-contact charge transfer:*** To ensure the durability of freestanding rotational triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) devices, it is necessary to elimate friction between the dieletectric layers, while still allowing for the creation of triboelectric charges. This is most important for TENG devices meant to act as electricity generators, such as those developed in this project, as the developed TENG device is meant to be used in rural areas where access to resources and regular maintenance is limited. The idea of using polyester fur to allow for the creation of electrostatic charge while reducing friction was originally proposed in 2021, and has been adapted for the TENG devices used in this project.

***Use of fog harp geometry for electrostatic fog net design:*** To avoid common drawbacks of the mesh geometry for use in fog nets, it is necessary to adopt a new fog net geometry. This is most important for electrostatic fog nets, such as those developed in this project, as mesh clogging distorts the electric field of the fog net electrodes and reduces the electric discharge. The idea of using vertical wires arranged in a "harp-like" pattern was originally proposed in 2018, and has been adapted for use in electrostatic fog collection powered by TENG devices.
