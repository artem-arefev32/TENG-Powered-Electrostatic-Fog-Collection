**Use of polyester fur for soft-contact charge transfer.** To ensure the durability of freestanding rotational triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) devices, it is necessary to elimate friction between the dieletectric layers, while still allowing for the creation of triboelectric charges. This is most important for TENG devices that would be used in rural areas where access to resources and regular maintenance is limited. The idea of using polyester fur to allow for the creation of electrostatic charge while reducing friction was originally proposed in 2021, and has been adapted for the TENG devices used in this project.
